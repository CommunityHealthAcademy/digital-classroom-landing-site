  COVID-19 Digital Classroom
</h1>

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone Repository**

    ```shell
      git clone git@github.com:CommunityHealthAcademy/digital-classroom-landing-site.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into the site's directory and start it up.

    ```shell
      cd digital-classroom-landing-site
      gatsby develop
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in the project.

```shell
├── src
│   ├── components
│   └── pages
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
└── package.json
```

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser).

2.  **`/components`**: This directory will contain all of the components you will see on the browser.

3.  **`/pages`**: This directory will contain all of the pages you will see on the browser.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

7.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

## Commit Strategy

Our codebase uses [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) which lints our commits to the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#specification) specification.

The way we structure our commits is as follows:

```shell
<type>(<optionalscope>): some sort of commit message
```

### Type

Can be anything of:

build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test

### scope

The scope is normaly the feature type i.e. footer. This is optional and not required in the commit

### message

The message is normally an indication of what is added (or removed). It should summarise the main change made to the code base in that commit

### Example commit

```
feat(footer): Add footer design
```
